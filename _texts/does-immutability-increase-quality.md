experiment: Does immutability actually increase quality inherently? 


Experiment: Write deal manager program in React / JS 

Write program using a mutable view model (https://github.com/amw-zero/deal-mangement/blob/master/src/dealManagement.test.js#L141-L143)

Write the same program using an immutable-by-default language (maybe using Reason?)

See if the immutability causes the correct program to be written
