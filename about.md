For whatever reason, I've become increasingly more interested in software quality over the past few years. Maybe it's the perfectionist element- bugs bother me to the core, and the holy grail of "perfectly functioning software" is very enticing. Or it's the challenge of it- it's a puzzle of infamous difficulty, and I love the endorphin rush that comes at the end of a good puzzle. There's the human element too- a huge part of quality is determining whether or not the software is pleasing to its customers, and there's no greater joy than building something that people enjoy.

While these may explain my initial interest, there's a third element that keeps me hooked on the topic: its practical necessity. Today, teams of programmers are tasked with building and modifying applications of intimidating complexity week after week. Requirements change every day. Bugs are fixed as they arise. We've created innumerable tools focused on enabling software construction, but are we ending up with products that provide their advertised value to customers?

I think this puts us in the middle of a [second software crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis)

I'm hoping to collect posts here that circle around this one central notion, to be able to consider different aspects of the problem in an exploratory environment. If nothing else, it may be a useful resource for considering the many dimensions of software quality in one place.
