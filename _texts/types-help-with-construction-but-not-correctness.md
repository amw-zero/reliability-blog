Paradox of dependent types:

Logic still needs to map values to types, and that logic can be incorrect. Who will watch the watchmen?

The benefit of types is that when you make a change the compiler can catch typos and other statically checkable errors, as well as letting you "enforce" that other developers follow certain patterns and conventions.
