For whatever reason, I've become increasingly more interested in software reliability over the past few years. Maybe it's the perfectionist element- bugs bother me to the core, and the holy grail of "perfectly functioning software" is very enticing to me. Or it's the challenge of it- it's a puzzle of infamous difficulty, and I love the endorphin rush that comes at the end of a good puzzle.

That may explain my interest in the topic, but there's a third element that keeps me hooked and that is its practical importance. I also try and always remain grounded in the practical when thinking about techniques that result in more reliable software. For example, an automated test suite is an investment towards reliability, but I also want to analyze its costs. 

I'm hoping to collect posts here that circle around this one central notion, to be able to riff on different aspects of the problem and 

That's not to say that I'm not interested in esoteric or unconventional techniques. In order for a change to be made (and I believe a change should be made), we need to try different things. So I will engage in thought experiments, prototyping new designs, anything that ultimately results in a new bit of information about software reliability. That's the plan at least. 

My current thinking is that the answer involves math, specifically logic. I think lightweight formal specification and model checking (with tools such as [Alloy](http://alloytools.org/) and [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) is a very compelling idea. So is [property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/), which is a variation on that theme. As I said, practicality is still a value of mine though, so I don't want the math to be too theoretical. A common antipattern I see is losing the forest for the trees when starting to bring math into the picture. The math needed to achieve software reliability seems much more like applied mathematics vs. pure mathematics, though we may drift into theory when it's relevant. We'll always tie it back to a practical goal though.

While I don't think it's particularly consequential, my identity may offer a bit of color to the ideas captured here.
